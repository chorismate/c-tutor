# c-tutor
`c-tutor` is a simple tutorial for ANSI C based on *The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition*.

## Prerequisites
- A C compiler. The solutions given have been tested on Apple Clang version 14.0.0 `-Weverything -pedantic`, compiling to x86_64. If you encounter issues with either Clang or GCC on a commonly used Unix-like system, please raise an issue.
- A Unix shell. The script is written for the Almquist shell and should work with more complex ones like `bash`.
- A text editor. Since this is intended for beginners, `pico` is used as the default.

## Installation
Clone the repository and enter it via a command-line, then run the following command:
```
./tutor.sh
```
This immediately opens up the tutor. No farther configuration is needed.
To uninstall, just delete the directory you created when cloning the repository.

## License
